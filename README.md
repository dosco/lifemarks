An iOS app to track your daily activity. This app leverages the Apple M7 / M8 co-processor
to fetch daily activity data like steps walked, time of inactivity, etc. The final idea is
to aggrerate activity data in a server backend and be able to compare your activity levels
with those around you at work. The name is a play on benchmarks.
